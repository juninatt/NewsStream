# NewsStream

NewsStream is a Java application built with Spring Boot and Maven that fetches news articles from [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
based on user-defined criteria. It combines data collection, subscriptions, and notifications to deliver near real-time updates on specific news topics.

## Features

* **News Collection and Filtering**:
  Fetches articles from [News API](https://newsapi.org/) based on user-specific topics and categories.
  Articles can be saved in the database or used directly for notifications.
* **Email Notifications**:
  Sends email notifications using [MailSender](https://www.mailersend.com/).
  Requires either a verified sender or a registered domain in your MailSender account for notifications to work.
